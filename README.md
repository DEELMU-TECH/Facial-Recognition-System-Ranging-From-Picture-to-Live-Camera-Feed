# facialrecognitionsystem-picture-to-live-camera-feed
this facial recognition system recognises a person from a live camera feed. just place your picture in the known/denis folder and run using the laptop camera. i have tested on windows 10 therefore it might need some tweaking on linux or other operating systems.
